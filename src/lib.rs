//! This crate is my attempt at writting a FTP sync client
//! using Rust, it should contain most commands useful to
//! a regular client with ease of use. Additional internal
//! functionality is also exposed to avoid limiting the user
//! to the current implementation.
//!
//! Listing the files on the current working directory looks like
//! below when using this crate:
//! ```rust
//! use ftp_client::{error::Error, sync::Client};
//!
//! fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
//!     let server_name = std::env::var("SERVER_HOSTNAME").expect("SERVER_HOSTNAME is not set.");
//!     let mut client = Client::connect(&server_name, "user", "user")?;
//!     let names = client.list_names("/")?;
//!     println!("Listing names: ");
//!     for name in names {
//!         println!("{}", name);
//!     }
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
